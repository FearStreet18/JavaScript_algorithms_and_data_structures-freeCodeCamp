// const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. 
// They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned

// var should not exist in your code.
// Waiting: You should change fCC to all uppercase.
// Waiting: FCC should be a constant variable declared with const.
// Waiting: The string assigned to FCC should not be changed.
// Waiting: fact should be declared with let.
// Waiting: console.log should be changed to print the FCC and fact variables.

const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line
